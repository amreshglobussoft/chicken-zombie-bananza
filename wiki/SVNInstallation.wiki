Rules on making a commit
  # Don't commit if it will break the build!
  # Make sure you are committing all the files you need to.
  # You don't need to write a paragraph, but a short and sweet comment of what you did will help others see what you have done.
  # When working on a larger task, logically subdivide the task into subtasks and make commits when those tasks are complete. Don't wait until you are done to commit.
